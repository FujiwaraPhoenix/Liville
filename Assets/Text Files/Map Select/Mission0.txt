Mission 1
Late at night, the townsfolk began to hear strange noises outside. When a party was formed to investigate, they were attacked by strange monsters emerging from the woods and forced back into Ira's shed. Now, in order to escape, they have to take up arms and fight their way out!
A basic, starter mission with limited, weak enemies and a simple battlefield. Use the dual bottlenecks to practice strategies and test new weapons in this low-stakes environment.
